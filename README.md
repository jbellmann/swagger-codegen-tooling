### Swagger-Codegen-Tooling


The project provides some tooling around Maven and Gradle to generate code from OpenAPI-Specs. It comes with custom-templates to support Spring-MVC/Spring-Boot projects. Instead of generating code only once when a project starts (design phase), code will be generated at every build to make sure your code is in sync with
your spec. So controllers/resources are generated as interfaces developers have to implement then. So changes
in the spec should be reflected immediately on build/compile-step.

#### Getting started with Maven

To get started in a Maven project just add the following plugin-definition to you pom.xml.

```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.zalando.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>swagger-codegen-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version}</version>
        <configuration>
            <apiFile>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/api.yaml</apiFile>
            <language>springinterfaces</language>
            <apiPackage>com.example.project.api</apiPackage>
            <modelPackage>com.example.project.model</modelPackage>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <id>swagger-codegen</id>
                <goals>
                    <goal>codegen</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
```

According to your OpenAPI-spec (api.yaml) code will be generated in `${basedir}/target/generated-sources/swagger-codegen`

More examples how to use the Maven-Plugin can be found in the [integration-test](https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger-codegen-tooling/tree/master/swagger-codegen-maven-plugin/src/it) section.

#### Getting started with Gradle

To get started in a Gradle project, make sure the following configuration is present in your `build.gradle`

```
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'swagger-codegen'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.zalando.stups:swagger-codegen-gradle-plugin:${version}'
    }
}

swaggerCodegen {
    apiFile 'src/main/swagger-codegen/kio-api.yaml'
    language 'jaxrsinterfaces'
    apiPackage 'com.example.project.api'
    modelPackage 'com.example.project.model'
}

...
```

NOTE: The Swagger-Codegen-Gradle-Plugin is currently in development. So be prepared for changes.


### Development/Contribution


#### Build

The project itself uses Maven:

    mvn clean install

#### Run with integration-tests enabled

    mvn clean install -Pintegration

#### TODO's

* improve robustness for Gradle-Plugin
* improve Templates (what about [Controllers that delegate to an interface](https://github.com/zalando-stups/swagger-codegen-tooling/issues/32))
* improve documentation
* prepare an example that uses [spring-restdocs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs)
